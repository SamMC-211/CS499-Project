# CS499-Project
This project is to explore how to build a mobile application using **React Native** that can collect sensor data and apply machine learning–based activity recognition techniques.   The core idea is to leverage mobile device sensors to capture user behavioral signals and use machine learning models to classify certain states or activities.
